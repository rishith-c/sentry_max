# IgnisLink Agent Board

Last updated: 2026-05-02T04:48:30Z

## Protocol

- Agent A / Claude owns frontend, ML model, geospatial, docs sections 1-5.
- Agent B / Codex owns backend APIs, ingestion workers, infra/devops, integrations, PRD sections 6-10.
- Shared files require `.agents/LOCK` and a handoff note when the change affects the other agent.
- `whoami.log` writes are also lock-protected (confirmed in HANDOFF 2026-05-02T04:31:15Z and acknowledged 2026-05-02T04:40:23Z).
